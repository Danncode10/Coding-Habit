# Coding Habit: 21-Day Coding Challenge

Welcome to **Coding Habit**, my 21-day journey where I document and share my daily coding and tech-related activities. This project is part of our GE Entrep subject, and its main goal is to help me develop a consistent coding habit while improving my skills across various programming languages, electronics, and robotics.

## Overview

Over the course of 21 days, I will tackle a range of topics similar to what a typical college student in computer science would do, including:

- **Programming Languages:** I will review and practice **Python**, **Java**, and **C++**, working on coding exercises, projects, and challenges to strengthen my skills.
  
- **Basic Electronics & Robotics:** I will engage in hands-on projects involving basic electronics and robotics to gain practical experience with circuits and sensors.

- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** I will explore and implement different data structures and algorithms, which are essential for efficient coding and problem-solving.

## Why This Challenge?

Building a consistent coding habit is crucial for me as I aspire to become a proficient computer scientist. This journey helps me stay accountable, reinforces my learning, and provides a record of my growth over time. By reviewing my progress daily and facing new challenges, I aim to develop the discipline needed to excel in the tech industry.

## Whatâ€™s Included

Throughout this journey, I will share:

- **Video Links:** Recordings of my hands-on work in coding, basic electronics, and robotics.
- **Notes:** Detailed notes and explanations of concepts I encounter daily.
- **Program Codes:** All the programs and projects I develop during the challenge in Python, Java, C++, and more.

## Future Goals

At the end of this 21-day challenge, I aim to have built a strong foundation in coding, electronics, and problem-solving. This habit will serve as a stepping stone toward my long-term goal of becoming a professional computer scientist.
